Pyramid of Top 10 Most Populated Countries of the World(1960 to 2050)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary

Pyramid visualization shows who were , who are and who will be among the Top 10 most populated countries of the world from 1960 to 2050. Clearly the visualization shows some of the world powers like Germany, Japan, UK and Russia moving out of the Top 10 and also how developing countries like Ethopia, Philippines, Nigeria and Mexico are taking over the positions. One every important highlight is how African countries like Ethopia and Nigeria are moving up the ladder quickly. 


### Design
Initial design thought was to create a animated bar graph which shows the Top 10 most populated countries of the world. But after receiving the feedback personally from my friends I thought bar chart is not serving the purpose. Started looking for better visualization which can show the data in more appealing way. I came up with the idea of creating the pyramid in order to show case the Top 10 countries. Got very good feedback so continued with the pyramid design and came up with the final visualization with few iterations. Based on the feedback I decided to add a table like structure which gives information on how many times each of the countries were in top 10 between 1960 and 2050.

### Feedback

Feedback for index1.html:  
1) "Play all" does not look like click-able.  
2) Individual years does not look like click-able.  
3) Visualization does not show any findings from the data set.   
4) When you click on Play All it does not really look like the visualization is changing.   

Improvements made based on feedback on index1.html:  
1) "Play All" was changed to look like a buttons.  
2) Changed the look of the years to make look like click-able.  
3) When "Play All" is clicked, person can see the new country entering into Top 10.  
4) Every time a new country enters the Top 10, color of the bar is changed to brown for particular year.  

Feedback for index2.html:  
1) Bars without axis does not look meaningful.  
2) Also there could be a better way of representing the top 10 countries instead of bar chart.  
2) It is difficult to find out how many countries were in top 10 in this particular period 1960 - 2050.  
3) Size of the bars does not look to be uniform based on the ranking.  
4) There could be more appropriate title for the visualization.  

Improvements made based on feedback for index2.html:  
1) Created pyramid style visualization which gives better view of the Top10 countries of the world.  
2) Created a table kind of view to display how many times each of the countries in top 10.   
3) Changed the title and the caption for the title.   

Feedback for index3.html:  
1) Good improvements in the visualization.  
2) There should be a way to find out which countries entered the top 10 from 1960.  

Improvements based on feedback on index3.html:  
1) Made changes to the visualization to highlight the countries which entered into top 10 from 1960.  
2) This change also makes it clear how the countries go up and down the pyramid  
  
Feedback on index_final.html:  
1) Very different kind of visualization which shows the ranking of the countries.  
2) Highlighting which countries entered the top ten and stay in top 10 between 1960 to 2050 is also very informative.  
3) Table like information which shows how many times each of these countries where in top 10 is also very informative.
